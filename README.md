Hello, 

I love outdoor sports such as mountain running, skiing cross country and alpine, and many other activities in the wilderness. I am also a holder of a Canadian Commercial Pilot License, and I enjoy flying airplanes over many spectacular landscapes in Western Canada and USA! I have a very keen passion for learning and understanding how businesses function and grow. Ultimately I want to do good work that I'm proud of that contributes enormous value. I am excited to learn how to interpret and process data to help move towards a greener, more economical, and healthier planet!
